Zavd1: https://github.com/RomanZalizniy/Laboratorna3-TR23/blob/main/Zavd1.java Create a program FOR loop.


Zavd2: https://github.com/RomanZalizniy/Laboratorna3-TR23/blob/main/Zavd2.java Using the for loop, display information on the console: 
	0 h 0 min
	0 h 1 min
	0 h 2 min
	...
	...
	...
	2h 59 min

The nested for loop is executed for each hour from 0 to 2, and the inner for loop is executed for each minute from 0 to 59. Each iteration of the inner loop outputs a string to the console containing the hour and minute values in the required format.


Zavd3: https://github.com/RomanZalizniy/Laboratorna3-TR23/blob/main/Zavd3.java

The outer while loop is executed for each hour from 0 to 2, and the inner while loop
loop is executed for each minute from 0 to 59. Each iteration of the inner loop
displays a string on the console containing the hour and minute values in the
in the required format. Both loops are executed when the condition that the hours
has reached 3 (i.e., 2 hours 59 minutes).


Zavd4: https://github.com/RomanZalizniy/Laboratorna3-TR23/blob/main/Zavd4.java

Nested for loops are executed for each hour from 0 to 2, each minute from 0 to 59, and each 
second from 0 to 59. Each iteration of the inner loops outputs a string to the console containing 
the values of the hour, minute, and second in the required format.

This code first asks the user for the start and end points of the interval, as well as the step with which the function values will be calculated. Next, the function is tabulated and the number of its values that fall within the specified range is counted. The code uses both the for loop and the while loop. The function that needs to be tabulated is described by a separate f() method, and the printResult() method is used to display a message.
